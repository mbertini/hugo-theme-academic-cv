## Research activities and interests {#research-activities}

Marco Bertini works on pattern recognition, multimedia, AI and computer vision with applications to digital libraries and cultural heritage, video surveillance, autonomous driving, video coding and quality enhancement, image/video retrieval, and perceptual quality assessment. In recent years, activity has intensified on the use of GenAI and vision-language models for: (i) visual quality enhancement/assessment in images and videos (restoration, super-resolution, artifact removal, perceptual quality); (ii) composed/conditioned image retrieval guided by text and images; (iii) domain adaptation and sensing in non-visible scenarios (thermal, remote sensing); (iv) human-AI interaction and cultural heritage; (v) multimodal analysis in social and media contexts. This evolution builds on previous research lines - semantic annotation, multimedia ontologies, event/action analysis and content-based retrieval - extending them with generative techniques and multimodal contrastive representations.

_Perceptual quality and restoration._ GenAI methods have been developed to remove compression artifacts, enhance video quality in real time, and improve usability in videoconferencing and low-bandwidth streams, with applications to analog media restoration and SR/denoise pipelines for degraded video. The line includes contributions in IEEE TMM and award-winning demos at ACM MM, as well as work on super-resolution and analog tape restoration; this research led to the Small Pixels spin-off. On the assessment side, no-reference metrics based on language and manifold learning of distortions are proposed.

_Vision-language and composed retrieval._ A second line concerns composed/conditioned image retrieval (CIR): from refinement of CLIP-based and contrastive learning models (with a CVPR award-winning demo) to zero-shot approaches with textual inversion and prompt learning and related extensions (iSEARLE on T-PAMI; ICCV). These results improved robustness and controllability of text+image queries and opened use cases in fashion and multimedia. In this context, the CIRCO benchmark was developed and became a standard in the CIR field.

_Domain adaptation and sensing._ Layer-wise domain adaptation was addressed for pedestrian detection in thermal images and synthetic thermal data augmentation, as well as real-time surface landmine detection in optical imagery and the creation of synthetic datasets with microwave holographic imaging for buried landmine detection. These studies aim to bring reliable models to safety-critical scenarios for humanitarian demining and security applications where the visible spectrum is not usable. Collaboration with RFI on vision systems for high-speed rail safety analysis falls within this research area.

_Cultural heritage, HCI and media._ This activity includes the development of interactive and multimodal systems for museums/exhibitions (gamification of body/facial expressions; context-aware MLLM chatbot), studies on museum experiences, and tools to improve quality and accessibility of cultural content. This line also includes work on artwork classification with CLIP-based approaches and generative storytelling for cultural tourism.

_Multimodal analysis of social contexts and new datasets._ Recent work explored methods for relationship recognition, multimodal hate meme classification, pipelines and benchmarks for comics understanding, as well as generative applications and editing in fashion and 4D point cloud upsampling. These works extend the scope from classic video understanding to narrative, social, and creative domains.

Earlier research focused on automatic annotation of different types of video content and transcoding, including video summary creation and content-based compression. The main video types analyzed were news, sports, and surveillance. For news, methods were developed for annotation based on multiple media streams, including audio transcripts, on-screen text, high-level visual elements such as face/scene/object recognition, and mid/low-level visual features. For sports videos, algorithms were developed for event recognition adaptable to different contexts, including real-time annotation. Work also addressed defining unique signatures for fast duplicate detection to support IP protection and video structure analysis, as well as trademark and logo recognition.

Later, content-based video transcoding was addressed, with implications for Universal Multimedia Access, enabling multimedia adaptation to devices and networks with limited capacity while maintaining acceptable QoS for important events and allowing quality loss in less interesting segments.

Research on automatic video annotation combined knowledge management and semantic web tools such as RDF and OWL with multimedia data. Dynamic multimedia ontologies were developed, along with algorithms and tools for automatic and assisted video annotation. This led to studies of visual descriptors and modeling/learning methods for the temporal dimension of events/actions in video. Both spatio-temporal interest point descriptors (state of the art in human action recognition) and edit-distance kernels applied to spatial interest points for generic event recognition were investigated.

Content-based retrieval research also covered 3D object retrieval and interactive multi-user video search systems.

Finally, research activity included social media analysis for automatic annotation of images and videos, collaborative filtering, and recommendation. Work also addressed visual similarity search, using descriptor fusion based on embedding composition and approximate hashing mechanisms.
