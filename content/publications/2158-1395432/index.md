abstract: "The comic domain is rapidly advancing with the development of single- and
multi-page analysis and synthesis models. Recent benchmarks and datasets have
been introduced to support and assess models' capabilities in tasks such as
detection (panels, characters, text), linking (character re-identification and
speaker identification), and analysis of comic elements (e.g., dialog
transcription). However, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the
storyline, a model must not only extract elements but also understand their
relationships and generate highly informative captions. In this work, we
propose a pipeline that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to obtain
dense, grounded captions. To construct our pipeline, we introduce an
attribute-retaining metric that assesses whether all important attributes are
identified in the caption. Additionally, we created a densely annotated test
set to fairly evaluate open-source VLMs and select the best captioning model
according to our metric. Our pipeline generates dense captions with bounding
boxes that are quantitatively and qualitatively superior to those produced by
specifically trained models, without requiring any additional training. Using
this pipeline, we annotated over 2 million panels across 13,000 books, which
will be available on the project page
