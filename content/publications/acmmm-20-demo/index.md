abstract: "Lossy image and video compression algorithms introduce several types of visual artefacts that reduce the visual quality of the compressed media. In this work, we report results obtained using the NoGAN training approach and adapting the popular DeOldify architecture used for colorization, for image and video compression artefact removal and restoration."
