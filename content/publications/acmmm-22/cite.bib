  abstract = {In this demo we present two applications designed for the cultural heritage domain that exploit gamification techniques in order to improve fruition and learning of museum artworks. The two applications encourage users to replicate the poses and facial expressions of characters from paintings or statues, to help museum visitors make connections with works of art. Both applications challenge the user to fulfill a task in a funny way and provide the user with a visual report of the his/her experience that can be shared on social media, improving the engagement of the museums, and providing information on the artworks replicated in the challenge.},
